Project Overview

This project involves analyzing Zomato restaurant data using Python and its powerful libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to derive insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, and ratings using visualizations and statistical analysis. The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for ease of exploration and visualization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Determine whether online delivery is more popular than offline services.

Analyze the most favored restaurant types.

Identify the price range preferred by couples for dining.

Explore and visualize various columns including online_order, listed_in(type), rate, and approx_cost(for two people).

Visualization:

Generate histograms, count plots, box plots, and heatmaps to reveal patterns in the data.

Key Insights:

Majority preference for online vs. offline ordering.

Dining restaurants receiving the highest votes.

Ratings and cost distributions for better decision-making.
